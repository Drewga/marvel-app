# Marvel App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.4.

## Setup 

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Drewga/marvel-app.git`
2. [Install or upgrade](https://nodejs.org/en/download) Node. I recommend version 18.16.1, but other versions should work. Check Angular's [version compatibility docs](https://angular.io/guide/versions#actively-supported-versions).
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Enter a valid Marvel API key in environment.ts. You must also ensure localhost is an allowed referer in your Marvel account settings in order to run the app locally.
5. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
